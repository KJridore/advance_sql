For this assignment, I used Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and other libraries to set up a database and develop a web application to explore and analyze climate data, specifically focusing on precipitation and temperature observations. The dataset comes from a SQLite database containing information about measurements and stations. To interface with this database, SQLAlchemy ORM was used to provide a set of functionalities to effectively extract and manipulate the required data.

The first part of the analysis involved setting up routes in a Flask application to query the database and return JSON lists of precipitation, stations, and temperature observations. For example, the /api/v1.0/precipitation route calculates the date one year from the last date in the dataset and retrieves precipitation data for the last 12 months. The retrieved data is then converted to a dictionary and returned in JSON format, allowing easy access to precipitation information for the specified time period.

The second part of the analysis focused on station analysis. Using SQLAlchemy queries, I calculated the total number of stations, identified the most active station, and calculated the minimum, maximum, and average temperature at that station. For example, a route, /api/v1.0/stations, was designed to retrieve a JSON list of stations from the dataset. This allowed for a detailed understanding of the activity levels of the different stations and a comparison of their observations. I visualized the temperature observations of the most active station for the last 12 months with a histogram, which provides an intuitive representation of temperature frequency.

In addition to the above features, the Flask application also supports dynamic queries, allowing users to enter start and/or end dates to retrieve temperature statistics for a given date range. It uses Python's datetime library to parse and validate the date strings before executing the corresponding queries. Finally, to facilitate visualization and further analysis, I used Matplotlib and Pandas to plot the results, such as a bar chart showing monthly precipitation over the last 12 months and summary statistics for the precipitation data.
